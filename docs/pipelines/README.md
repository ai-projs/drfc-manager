# Pipelines

What are the Pipelines? They represent a sequence of steps that can be executed given a specific task.
In the context of DRfC it may be represented as the `Start/Stop Training Pipeline` 
or the `Start/Stop Evaluation Pipeline`.

Inside each one of the developed pipelines, we will have a sequence of steps including all possible cases with exceptions 
and not.

Each pipeline will have a specific design flow that you can find on its `.md` file and you can see below:
