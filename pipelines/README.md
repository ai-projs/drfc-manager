## Lib `Pipelines`

This lib is being developed directly using the same ideas and implementation of 
the repo https://github.com/aws-deepracer-community/deepracer-for-cloud according to its description is:
> "A quick and easy way to get up and running with a DeepRacer training environment using a cloud
> virtual machine or a local computer" 
> DRfC

The main purpose of this lib is to provide an easy way to manage your workflow inside the DRfC bringing 
the power of managing it inside a Jupyter Notebook to **optimize the training of your Reinforcement Learning Model** 
using pipelines to control these workflows.

Using this lib you will also use Machine Learning algorithms to enhance your training results due to being inside a 
environment controlled by Jupyter (Python).
